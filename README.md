# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Telecom Churn Analysis is our graduation project from ITI Track Power BI Developer.
This project aims to dive deep into the intricacies of telecom churn. Also, uncovering the reasons behind customer attrition. 
By gaining insights into the drivers of churn, the reasons behind this phenomenon are multi-faceted and range from dissatisfaction with services, competitive offers from rival providers, or shifts in customer preferences.
We aim to provide valuable knowledge to telecom companies, empowering them to take proactive steps to reduce churn rates and, in turn, enhance their overall performance.
